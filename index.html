                <h2>SerpRateAI</h2>
                <p>Climate change is having lasting effects such as changing ocean acidity, temperatures, and heights, increasing the chances of natural hazards such as forest fires and hurricanes, and leading to the disappearance of water sources supplied by glaciers and snow. Carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by humans is a primary contributor to man-made climate change thus finding storage mechanisms for human produced CO2 is necessary to mitigate climate change. Mantle rocks, like peridotite, offer a storage option for CO2, in the presence of water, peridotite will alter into new kinds of rocks. If CO2 is present in the water this CO2 will be stored as a solid in the rocks, keeping it trapped underground forever. Currently this chemical alteration process is well understood however the physical process that allows water to reach unaltered peridotite is not. SerpRateAI will discover the physical processes that allow water to be pumped underground to understand how peridotite alters. Ultimately we will produce natural alteration rates, i.e., how fast the rock changes over time. This can be used to estimate how much CO2 we can store in a region. Given that mantle rocks like peridotite are common, this could feasibly be used to store a large fraction of human produced CO2.</p>

                <h2>Exploring System Dynamics with AI Conference</h2>
                <p>AI/ML shows promise for accelerating Bayesian inversions, is able to capture and identify controlling features of high fidelity models, and appears to improve complex system analysis, including extending predictive horizons, for reasons that are not fully understood. This conference focuses on efforts to advance the use of AI/ML to understand physical processes in the geosciences and adjacent fields, and brings together practitioners and theorists from academia and industry for an open exchange of current results and discussions of future strategies. A central goal is to encourage diversity and collaboration between different disciplines, all through AI/ML practice, and to identify new connections between applications in fields, from networks to earthquakes, and turbulence to chaos. <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6zSfYNSRHalAsgIjHHsttpYfxJ_XIPbt&si=dHbOzNb3uvSXhVhA">You can view the lectures from the Oslo 2024 Conference here.</a></p>
